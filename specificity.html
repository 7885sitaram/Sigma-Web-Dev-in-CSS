<!--cascade algo rule 
1.Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear

2.Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

3.Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS

4.Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
